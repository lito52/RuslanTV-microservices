# Project Title

📺 RuslanTV

## Description

RuslanTV is a pet project aimed at building a YouTube-like video platform using a microservices architecture. The project focuses on scalable backend design, gRPC-based inter-service communication, asynchronous messaging, and observability.

RuslanTV demonstrates real-world backend patterns such as service decomposition, message queues, distributed monitoring, and cloud-ready storage solutions. The system is containerized and designed to be easily deployable and extensible. 

This project was built primarily for learning and experimenting with modern backend technologies and infrastructure.
